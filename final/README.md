## Econ 23050 Final

This folder contains all the code written for my final project on the geographic distribution of (AI) patent citations.
Because of Github file limits, I provide links to the datasets used in `prepare_datasets.py` below. Make sure to change
the file path if running the code.

- The `ai_model_predictions` file can be found at [USPTO Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/artificial-intelligence-patent-dataset)
- `g_assignee_disambiguated.tsv`, `g_application.tsv`, `g_location_disambiguated.tsv`, and `g_us_patent_citation.tsv` are all found on [PatentsView](https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables)
